##### EC504 Project - Fall 2015

## Getting Started
Weâ€™ve used the Node.JS web framework, Express. In order to use this app, make sure Node.JS is installed.
You can download Node.JS [here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## How To Run
Once Node.JS is installed, navigate to the project's directory and use your terminal to run the app.
> node app.js

And that's it! You can now view the app in your browser using the IP address and port number that is running the app. 
> e.g. '127.0.0.1:port'.
